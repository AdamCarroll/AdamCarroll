# About Me

I'm an experienced software developer and I've been building systems using Java since its very first public release. At work, I develop server-side software, mainly for Linux systems. Outside of work, I've had some fun building Open Source desktop software and you can find my projects here on GitHub.

# My Open Source Projects

I've enjoyed developing these projects and they have also been a great way to experiment with technology and to learn. The systems themselves are useful to me and I hope to others too. They're fully self-contained so please do download them and give them a try for yourself.

* [VocabHunter] helps learners of foreign languages find vital new vocabulary to study.
* [Santulator] is a Secret Santa draw generator that creates beautiful PDFs for each participant.

# Blogging

From time to time I blog, sharing ideas and things I've learned about technology that I think might be useful to others. I mainly use the [VocabHunter Blog] to publish my articles. Here are some of my posts:

* [Installable Java Apps with jpackage] - In this article I share what I learnt about using jpackage to create self-contained bundles from Java applications. The great thing about these bundles is that you can distribute your application without requiring your users to first install Java.
* [Open Source & Secret Santa with Santulator] - This post gives a few details on how Santulator works behind the scenes including how JavaFX CSS is used to create the festive colour scheme in the user interface.
* [How JavaFX was used to build a desktop application] - A detailed look at several important features of JavaFX using VocabHunter as an example.
* [Read (Almost) Any Document in Java] - How you can use Apache Tika to read documents in a wide variety of formats ranging from Microsoft Word through to PDF.
* [Dependency Injection in JavaFX] - How Gluon Ignite and Google Guice are used for the Dependency Injection in VocabHunter.
* [User Interface Testing with TestFX] - A guide to automating user interface tests using TestFX. Both VocabHunter and Santulator include a complete automated GUI test suite and in this article I explain how these suites work.
* [Building a JavaFX Search Bar] - How the user interface for the VocabHunter search bar works with details of the use of ControlsFX in giving the bar a distinctive style.
* [VocabHunter - A tool for learners of foreign languages] - An introduction to some of the technologies being used in VocabHunter.
